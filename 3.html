        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS</a> is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
